Background: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a global public health problem. For the fulfillment of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the promotion of preventive care medicine through HAI management is a crucial issue. This study explores the perspectives of Saudi tertiary healthcare workers (HCWs) on HAIs and infection control measures. Methods: Quantitative data were assessed to determine HCWs' knowledge of HAI and their attitudes towards and practice of infection control measures. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 40 doctors and nurses. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Further, routine sterile procedures in the wards and intensive care units were video recorded, and the footage was discussed by the infection control team and the personnel involved in the videos. This discussion was videographed and transcribed. Both interview data and reflective discussion of the video were analysed using thematic analysis. The quantitative data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis.Feline infectious peritonitis is a multisystemic disease of domestic and exotic cats caused by a coronavirus. An outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis was investigated in a closed colony of European wildcats (Fells silvestris) at a zoological garden. Over a six-year period, a putative fading kitten syndrome occurred in six of 11 litters born and severe lesions of infectious peritonitis occurred in five of the eight wildcats retained in the colony during this period. Lesions were more acute in the early stages of the outbreak and included perivascular pyogranulomatons inflammation with exudative serositis. Lesions occurred only in males. Vascular lesions were common in the liver of all affected wildcats, serositis occurred in the abdominal and thoracic cavities in most cases and meningeal lesions were present in two cases. Immunohistochemistry with specific antisera detected viral antigen within macrophages in all lesions. This outbreak demonstrates that the lesions of feline infectious peritonitis can become modified over time and that the virus can persist in a closed colony, possibly via carrier wildcats.China Lessons s u m m a r y More than 2 years after the start of pandemic H1N1, the world is fortunate that the impact, to date, has been moderate. An evaluation of the global response to the first wave of the pandemic is still ongoing. The results of an analysis of the situation in China is presented in order to gain a better understanding of the episode; to summarize the experiences in preparedness, control and mitigation of the pandemic; and to identify issues for further consideration and investigation in order to improve the response to possible next waves of the pandemic. China's response shows how a huge challenge can be transformed into an opportunity, and may offer some valuable lessons to face another wave of the pandemic or other potential public health emergencies in the future, not only for China but also for the international community.Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis currently used as a vaccine against tuberculosis. Global distribution and propagation of BCG has contributed to the in vitro evolution of the vaccine strain and is thought to partially account for the different outcomes of BCG vaccine trials. Previous efforts by several molecular techniques effectively identified large sequence polymorphisms among BCG daughter strains, but lacked the resolution to identify smaller changes. In this study, we have used a NimbleGen tiling array for whole genome comparison of 13 BCG strains. Using this approach, in tandem with DNA resequencing, we have identified six novel large sequence polymorphisms including four deletions and two duplications in specific BCG strains. Moreover, we have uncovered various polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus. Importantly, these polymorphisms affect genes encoding established virulence factors including cell wall complex lipids, ESX secretion systems, and the PhoP-PhoR two-component system. Our study demonstrates that major virulence factors are different among BCG strains, which provide molecular mechanisms for important vaccine phenotypes including adverse effect profile, tuberculin reactivity and protective efficacy. These findings have important implications for the development of a new generation of vaccines.Background: Molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays are increasingly used to diagnose viral respiratory infections and conduct epidemiology studies. Molecular assays have generally been evaluated by comparing them to conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or viral culture techniques, with few published direct comparisons between molecular methods or between institutions. We sought to perform a real-world comparison of two molecular respiratory viral diagnostic methods between two experienced respiratory virus research laboratories. Methods: We tested nasal and throat swab specimens obtained from 225 infants with respiratory illness for 11 common respiratory viruses using both a multiplex assay (Respiratory MultiCode-PLx Assay [RMA]) and individual real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR).Results: Both assays detected viruses in more than 70% of specimens, but there was discordance. The RMA assay detected significantly more human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while RT-rtPCR detected significantly more influenza A. We speculated that primer differences accounted for these discrepancies and redesigned the primers and probes for influenza A in the RMA assay, and for HMPV and RSV in the RT-rtPCR assay. The tests were then repeated and again compared. The new primers led to improved detection of HMPV and RSV by RT-rtPCR assay, but the RMA assay remained similar in terms of influenza detection.Given the absence of a gold standard, clinical and research laboratories should regularly correlate the results of molecular assays with other PCR based assays, other laboratories, and with standard virologic methods to ensure consistency and accuracy.Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than 700,000 annual deaths. Lack of a robust infrastructure for timely collection, reporting, and analysis of epidemic data undermines necessary preparedness and thus posing serious health challenges to the general public. By developing a simulation framework that models population dynamics and the interactions of both humans and mosquitoes, we may enable epidemiologists to analyze and forecast the transmission and spread of an infectious disease in specific areas. We extend the traditional SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) mathematical model and propose an Agent-based model to analyze the interactions between the host and the vector using: (i) our proposed algorithm to compute vector density, based on the reproductive behavior of the vector; and (ii) agent interactions to simulate transmission of virus in a spatio-temporal environment, and forecast the spread of the disease in a given area over a period of time. Our simulation results identify several expected dengue cases and their direction of spread, which can help in detecting epidemic outbreaks. Our proposed framework provides visualization and forecasting capabilities to study the epidemiology of a certain region and aid public health departments in emergency preparedness.Aeschynomene fluminensis Veil., originally obtained from flooded areas of the Pantanal Matogrossense region of Brazil, was grown under stem-flooded or non-flooded conditions for 70 d after inoculation with isolates of photosynthetic stem nodule rhizobia obtained from native A. fluminensis. Stem nodules formed only on submerged stems of flooded plants (mean of 25 per plant), and did not form on aerial parts, although they were capable of growing and fixing N^ after drainage of the stems. Root nodules formed on both non-flooded and flooded plants but were usually decreased in number by flooding (from means of 124 to 51 per plant, respectively). Flooding (and stem-nodulation) resulted in an increase in shoot (and a decrease in root) dry weight, regardless of rhizobial isolate. Stem nodules were attached by a wide collar of aerenchymatous tissue at the base of the nodule. There were large air spaces in the stem where nodules were subtended and these were continuous with nodule aerenchyma/outer corte.x. In addition, aerenchyma and spongy tissue at the base of the nodule connected both flooded and non-flooded root nodules to large intercellular spaces in the root cortex. The stem and root nodules were ovoid in shape, and essentially aeschynomenoid in type, i.e. the central infected tissue was without uninfected, interstitial cells. Root nodules had a similar structure to stem nodules (although stem nodules were generally larger), and flooded root nodules were approximately twice the size of non-flooded nodules. The infected tissue of root and stem nodules consisted of spherical, bacteroid-containing cells containing one or two rod-shaped bacteroids per peribacteroid unit and prominent organelles. Infection threads were observed in root but not in stem nodules.The cortex of stem and root nodules had an apparent oxygen diffusion barrier, consisting of concentric layers of small cells with interlocking cell walls and few intercellular spaces. Cell layers external to these consisted of larger cells and intercellular spaces, with some spaces being occluded with an electron-dense material that contained a glycoprotein recognized by the monoclonal antibodies MAC236 and MAC265. The amount of glycoprotein occlusions did not appear to differ between nodule types or treatments, although stem nodules contained intracellular glycoprotein vesicles adjacent to cell walls. The exterior of the nodules consisted of an epidermis of thin flattened cells with occasional lenticels. Amyloplasts were common in lower stem and hypocotyl nodules, but fewer in flooded or non-flooded root nodules. Upper stem nodules (i.e. those within 6 cm of the water surface) differed from more profoundly submerged stem nodules by having chloroplasts throughout the cortex. Root nodules did not contain chloroplasts, and undifferentiated plastids were found mainly in lower stem nodules.The evolutionarily conserved human polymerase delta (POLD1) gene encodes the large p125 subunit which provides the essential catalytic activities of polymerase Œ¥ (PolŒ¥), mediated by 5‚Ä≤-3‚Ä≤ DNA polymerase and 3‚Ä≤-5‚Ä≤ exonuclease moieties. POLD1 associates with three smaller subunits (POLD2, POLD3, POLD4), which together with Replication Factor C and Proliferating Nuclear Cell Antigen constitute the polymerase holoenzyme. PolŒ¥ function is essential for replication, with a primary role as the replicase for the lagging strand. PolŒ¥ also has an important proofreading ability conferred by the exonuclease activity, which is critical for ensuring replicative fidelity, but also serves to repair DNA lesions arising as a result of exposure to mutagens. PolŒ¥ has been shown to be important for multiple forms of DNA repair, including nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. A growing number of studies in the past decade have linked germline and sporadic mutations in POLD1 and the other subunits of PolŒ¥ with human pathologies. Mutations in PolŒ¥ in mice and humans lead to genomic instability, mutator phenotype and tumorigenesis. The advent of genome sequencing techniques has identified damaging mutations in the proofreading domain of POLD1 as the underlying cause of some inherited cancers, and suggested that mutations in POLD1 may influence therapeutic management. In addition, mutations in POLD1 have been identified in the developmental disorders of mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features and lipodystrophy and atypical Werner syndrome, while changes in expression or activity of POLD1 have been linked to senescence and aging. Intriguingly, some recent evidence suggests that POLD1 function may also be altered in diabetes. We provide an overview of critical PolŒ¥ activities in the context of these pathologic conditions.Pathogen surveillance in free-ranging carnivores presents challenges due to their low densitie and secretive nature. We combined molecular and serological assays to investigate infections by viral pathogens (Canine parvovirus (CPV), Canine distemper virus (CDV) and Canine coronavirus (CCoV)) in Portuguese carnivores (Canis lupus, Vulpes vulpes, Lutra lutra, Martes foina, M. martes, Meles meles, and Genetta genetta) over a period of 16 years. Additionally we explored spatio-temporal patterns of virus occurrence in Canis lupus. Our study identified CPV DNA in all carnivore species with an overall prevalence of 91.9 %. CPV was detected in all sampled years and seasons in Canis lupus, supporting its enzootic nature. CDV RNA was mainly detected in the Canidae family, with viral nucleic acid recorded between 2005 and 2008 with a peak prevalence of 67 % among the wolf population, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting an epizootic behaviour of the virus. Antibodies show that mustelids and viverrids were often exposed to CDV. CCoV was first recorded by molecular methods in wolf samples in 2002, remaining in the wolf populations with marked fluctuations over time. The dual serological and molecular approach provided important epidemiological data on pathogens of wild carnivores in Portugal. These programmes should also include monitoring of other potential reservoir hosts such as domestic cats and dogs.All rights reserved.

In this report, comprised of 2 large connected sets of data, SKP2 and its association with BECN1 is examined for their roles in regulating autophagy. The authors identify how SKP2 effects BECN1 levels via ubiquitination and how inhibition of SKP2 by either siRNA or inhibitory compounds effect BECN1 and autophagy. The report then presents data on the role of autophagy and MERS-CoV where live virus and individual MERS-CoV proteins are shown to effect autophagy flux. The large amount of data is technically impressive however significant questions arose on this review.Background: Various transcription factors are involved in the process of mutually exclusive expression and clonal variation of the Plasmodium multigene (var) family. Recent studies revealed that a P. falciparum SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin (PfSWIB) might trigger stage-specific programmed cell death (PCD), and was not only crucial for the survival and development of parasite, but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins. However, it remains unclear whether PfSIWB is involved in transcriptional regulation of this virulence gene and its functional properties.Methods: A conditional knockdown system "PfSWIB-FKBP-LID" was introduced to the parasite clone 3D7, and an integrated parasite line "PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID" was obtained by drug cycling and clone screening. Growth curve analysis (GCA) was performed to investigate the growth and development of different parasite lines during 96 h in vitro culturing, by assessing parasitemia. Finally, we performed qPCR assays to detect var gene expression profiling in various comparison groups, as well as the mutually exclusive expression pattern of the var genes within a single 48 h life-cycle of P. falciparum in different parasite lines. In addition, RNA-seq was applied to analyze the var gene expression in different lines.Results: GCA revealed that conditional knockdown of PfSWIB could interfere with the growth and development of P. falciparum. The parasitemia of PfSWIB‚àÜ showed a significant decline at 96 h during in vitro culture compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 lines (P < 0.0001). qPCR and RNA-seq analysis confirmed that depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in PfSWIB‚àÜ line, but also leads to aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-h life-cycle.We demonstrated that PfSWIB was involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and crucial for the survival and development of Plasmodium parasite. These findings could provide better understanding of the mechanism and function of PfSWIB contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites.Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co-and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co-and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities.Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value < 0.01 (ROC values > 0.75 or < 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono-and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks.Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with immunogenetic factors. This study was planned to test for the association of TNF-Œ± ‚àí 308 and IFN-Œ≥ +874 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility and severity of SLE in Egyptian cases. Subjects and methods: This is a case controlled study including 125 Egyptian cases with SLE in addition to 112 healthy unrelated individuals from the same locality. For all participants, TNF-Œ± ‚àí 308 G NA and IFN-Œ≥ + 874 ANT genetic polymorphisms were characterized using the PCR technique. Results: Cases with SLE showed a significantly higher TNF-Œ± ‚àí308 A allele carriage rate (AA + GA genotypes) compared to controls (26.4% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.009, OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.26-4.99). These cases showed also a significantly higher carriage rate for the IFN-Œ≥ +874 T allele (AT + TT genotypes) compared to controls (47.2% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.02, OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.11-3.21). Comparing age, gender, and disease severity presented by nephritis class, activity and chronicity indices in cases carrying the TNF-Œ± ‚àí308 A allele and in cases carrying IFN-Œ≥ +874 T allele versus others showed no significant difference (p N 0.05). Conclusions: TNF-Œ± ‚àí308 A and IFN-Œ≥ +874 T allele carriage are associated with susceptibility but not severity of SLE in Egyptian subjects.
